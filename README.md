# React Starter Project with Firebase and MUI

>In order to run the project you need to init firebase and update your project settings first!

This repo is a starter project with MUI & Firebase support.

You will find several sample pages and design styles.

Responsive Navbar and Context API

React Hooks for Firebase Auth:
- Signup
- Login
- Logout

React Router:
- Sample page routes
- User protected pages

### Firebase 
- First you need to create a Firebase Project on your Firebase console. 
- In the project while in the root folder run the code below.  So that it will update ".firebaserc"  and "firebase.json" files depending on your own firebase project name.

	  firebase init

- Update "firebaseConfig.js" file which is inside "src\services\firebaseService" with your own firebase project settings.

### Installation
	npm install


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
